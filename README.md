# Calorie Burn Rate Prediction Hub 🏋️‍♂️🔮

Welcome to the Calorie Burn Rate Prediction Hub, where data science meets fitness magic! This repository is not just about predicting calorie burn rates; it's a creative playground for health enthusiasts and data wizards.

## 🌟 Galactic Fitness Data
### [Explore the Universe of Fitness Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moathmohamed/fitness-data)
Embark on a journey through the vast dataset of fitness wonders. Uncover the secrets hidden within the numbers and discover the keys to predicting calorie burn rates.

## 🚀 Mission Control: Workflow
### 1. Data Odyssey:
- The fitness data is our cosmic canvas, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moathmohamed/fitness-data).
- Dive deep into the data, unraveling the mysteries of features and target variables related to calorie burn rates.

### 2. Pre-Processing & Star Mapping:
- Cleanse and prepare the dataset for a cosmic voyage.
- Engage in exploratory data analysis (EDA) to navigate the constellations of fitness metrics and calorie burn rates.

### 3. Modeling Nebulas:
- Harness the power of machine learning models, especially the GradientBoostingRegressor.
- Experiment with the cosmic algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize the model for predicting calorie burn rates.

### 4. Evaluation Galaxy:
- Assess the model's performance using celestial regression metrics.
- Witness the power of the GradientBoostingRegressor:
  - **Number of Estimators:** 150
  - **Learning Rate:** 1.5
  - **Maximum Depth:** 3
